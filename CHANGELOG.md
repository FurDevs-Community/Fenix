## 0.7.0-alpha.3 - 2020-07-10

### Fixed

## 0.7.0-alpha.1 - 2010-07-10

### Added

- Changelog
- Help command which dynamically takes data from other command files to generate a help embed.

### Changed

- [BREAKING] Drago now uses the Sails.js framework with Discord.js plugged in. This allows for future development of web
  interfaces. All development from 0.6 and earlier is NOT compatible with 0.7.
- Several of the commands from 0.6.x have been migrated to 0.7 (api/helpers/commands) with changes.
    - Currently, commands do NOT support sub-folders nor aliases. Plans are to support this in the future.
    - Currently, command parameters must be separated with a " | " or a double-space. A single space will not work. It
      is unknown if this will be fixed; single space separation causes problems for multiple string inputs.
    - util/execProcess.js is available for commands that execute things in terminal / command prompt.
    - Credits command has its own credits configurable object at the top to easily modify it without modifying the embed
      code.
- Data is now stored via sails.models (api/models) and the waterline ORM. Each model represents a database table. Each
  model can also use its own database engine.
- exec command is now execute command because exec is a reserved sails.js function.
- eval command is now evaluate command because eval is a reserved Node.js function.
- Default configuration is located in config/custom.js. Actual config values should be set in config/local.js. Do NOT
  commit local.js!
- Code is being formatted with Prettier, and more care is being made to add comments and documentation.
- Changelog command now utilizes this changelog file.

## 0.6.1 - 2020-07-04

### Added

- [WIP] Suggest, where you can make a bot suggestion.
- [WIP] Setup command to set up the bot and create the mute role.

### Changed

- You can now ban members that are not in the guild.
